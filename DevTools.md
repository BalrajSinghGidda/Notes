## What are DevTools?

- DevTools are technologies that make software development faster.

- Software development is a complex process of translating real-world objects into mathematical and electronic representations that machines can understand and manipulate.

- DevTools acts as an interface b/w the physical reality and computing processes. They include programming languages, frameworks, and platforms that abstract different levels of complexity.

- This means you can interact with computers more easily and solve more complex problems. Instead of working with hardware components and low-level coding languages, you can work with libraries, APIs, and other abstractions that prioritize business use cases.

## Benifits

- Improve code quality: Helps in writing cleaner code. Since every Dev has their own style, these helps everyone follow the same coding standards and best practices.

- Reduce coding error: Mistakes in code can be difficult and expensive to fix. DevTools help find and fix error during development.

- Develop cross-platform applications: cross-platform applications can run on different devices using the same code.

- Shorten development time: DevTools automate many tasks.

## Types of DevTools

- Coding:
  - With coding tools you can write, edit, build and test code.
  - Eg.

- Programming support:
  - helps make software development faster and easier.
  - Eg: IDE.

- DevOps:
  - With DevOps tools, devs can work closely with operating engineers to respond to technical issues or implement feature updates.
  - Eg: Git, GitHub, Docker.

- Software Testing:
  - With software testing tools, you detect bugs, technical issues, and vulnerabilities.

## Common DevTools Panels

- Elements (Inspector):
  - View and edit HTML structure
  - Modify CSS styles live
  - See box models (margin, borders, padding)
  - Useful for fixing layout and styling issues.

- Sources

- Network
  - shows all HTTP requests
  - View requests/response headers and payloads.
