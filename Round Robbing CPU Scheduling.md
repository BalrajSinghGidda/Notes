- Time quantum means a ==CPU== will run a ==process== for a particular ==time period==, *Eg:- 2*.
- After this time period, the process is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">shifted</mark> from to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ready to running queue</mark> state.
- Then another process comes in the running state and same happens till all processes are done.
- Sequence is vital, and we use ready queue along-with the running queue.
